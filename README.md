# Drone-surveillance-System

Problem Statement Description:
Cochin Port is having water bodies and a land area of 2177 acres. Licenses are being issued by the Port to the marine vessels to ply within the Port limit.  
In the below section, solutions to the queries mentioned in the problem statement is discussed.


**Introduction**:
The drone-based surveillance system, Dron-A, is designed to address key challenges in monitoring vessels in port areas and detecting encroachments. The system utilizes hardware and software components to ensure maritime security and operational efficiency.

**Some of the critical aspects and solutions include:**
1) Using trained models for IMO detection and real-time database checks minimizes unauthorized access and security threats. A dashboard streams live video, allowing for the detection of suspicious activities, and alerts are sent to port authorities.
2) To efficiently cover the extensive areas of Cochin Port, multiple drones are deployed to monitor the main areas effectively.
3) The drones are designed to withstand harsh weather conditions prevalent on the coast, ensuring continuous operation.

**Features:**
1) A circular drone replacement system is implemented to address short drone battery life. When a drone's battery is low, it is replaced with a charging buffer drone, ensuring uninterrupted surveillance
2) The drone specifications include hardware components like carbon fiber frames, motors, flight controllers, and cameras. Automated drone control is achieved using Betaflight and GPS modules. Database and communication rely on MySQL and analog signals.
3) For surveillance and vessel detection, Python and development frameworks like OpenCV, Tensorflow, and Pytesseract are employed. Machine learning models, including OCR and CNN, aid in IMO number detection and country flag identification. The system also includes a dashboard with MySQL database support, front-end development, and hosting on Microsoft Azure.
4) Security features involve user authentication, SQL injection prevention, and data transmission through secure channels.

**Conclusion:**
 Overall, the drone-based surveillance system offers an integrated solution to enhance maritime security, detect encroachments, and efficiently manage vessel-related information within the port area.
